Project-S: My First Steps in OOP - Cipher Challenges and Travel-Time Computations
Welcome to Project-S, where I embark on my journey into object-oriented programming (OOP) through two foundational projects:

Challenge 1: Cipher Puzzle Program
Unlock the secrets of cryptography with our Cipher Puzzle Program. This project presents a 6-piece authentication puzzle, designed to test both logical reasoning and programming skills. As my first ever project in OOP, I delve into deciphering patterns and applying logical reasoning to crack the code.

Challenge 2: Travel-Time Calculator
Compute travel time between Earth and extraterrestrial bodies with our Travel-Time Calculator. Experience OOP principles in action as you input distances and observe Earth day estimations. Through this project, I gain valuable insights into the practical applications of OOP concepts.

Join me on this academic journey as I take my first steps into OOP with Project-S.
